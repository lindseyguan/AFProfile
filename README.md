# AFProfile
Improved protein complex prediction with AlphaFold-multimer by denoising the MSA profile.
\
AFProfile manipulates the MSA representation by learning residuals to the MSA profile that are more useful for the network.
This is analogous to a denoising diffusion process over the MSA and proves to be a highly efficient process resulting in better structures.
